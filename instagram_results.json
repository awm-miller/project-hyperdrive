He photographed this great white shark off Maine's coast from just four feet away. Sightings of sharks like this 10-footer are increasing from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia, due in part to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which allowed seal populations to rebound.\n\nNational Geographic photographers ventured to places far and wide to capture the year’s most fascinating images.

      "caption": "Photo by @joshuacogan | A honu—Hawaiian green sea turtle—glides among blossoms in Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park. Once on the brink of extinction due to habitat loss, these ancient mariners began a remarkable comeback in the 1970s through protections and local conservation. Though challenges like pollution and climate change remain, their return reflects the power of science, culture, and stewardship. In Hawaiian tradition, the honu symbolizes wisdom and perseverance. It is often regarded as an ‘aumākua, or ancestral guardian. To see one in the wild is to witness resilience in motion, a reminder to keep moving forward. | See how these turtles mirror a similar story of perseverance in Ho’omau: Joey’s Journey, proudly presented by argenx.
